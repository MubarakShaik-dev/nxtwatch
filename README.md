üß© Challenges & Solutions
1. JWT Authentication & Route Protection
Challenge:
Ensuring that only authenticated users could access Home, Trending, Gaming, Saved Videos, and Video Details pages.

Solution:
Created a ProtectedRoute component that checks for a valid JWT token stored in cookies (js-cookie). If the token is missing, it redirects the user to the /login route.

2. Theme Synchronization Across Routes
Challenge:
Maintaining light/dark theme consistency across all pages and components without prop-drilling.

Solution:
Implemented a global theme context using React Context API and wrapped the app with ThemeProvider from styled-components. The theme toggle state is stored in Context so it updates instantly everywhere.

3. Debounced Search Functionality
Challenge:
Preventing excessive API calls while typing in the search bar on the Home page.

Solution:
Added a debounce mechanism with setTimeout and useEffect cleanup to trigger API calls only after the user stops typing for a short delay.

4. Error Handling for API Failures
Challenge:
APIs like /videos/all, /videos/trending, and /videos/gaming sometimes fail due to network issues, and the app needed to handle it gracefully.

Solution:
Created a reusable Failure View component with retry buttons. On retry, the failed API function is re-invoked, keeping the user in control.

5. Saved Videos Persistence
Challenge:
Allowing users to save videos and still have them available after a page reload.

Solution:
Stored saved video data in a Context and persisted it using localStorage, ensuring the list is restored whenever the app is reloaded.

6. Responsive Design Across Devices
Challenge:
Making sure the UI looked consistent and functional on mobile, tablet, and desktop layouts.

Solution:
Used styled-components with media queries to create adaptive layouts, ensuring that the sidebar, header, and video grid adjust dynamically to different screen sizes.
